<p> &nbsp; I am a native Michigander and a fledgling web developer. I am eager to embark on this new challenge of becoming a programmer in order to acquire skills in a high-demand field and, in tune with this Amy Poehler quote, to push myself out of my comfort zone for the sake of continued professional and personal growth. I have a strong desire to leverage technology to create better experiences for users as well as an interest in developing web platforms that serve as instruments for addressing various social issues. My talents related to web development include resourcefulness in the face of challenges, collaborative group work, and creative content development. &nbsp; </p>

<p> <b>Here are five random things about me:</b> </p>
<p><ol> 
   <li> I am a known initiator of spontaneous workplace dance parties.</li>
   <li> I have a cat named Dobby the House Cat; she is sweet and annoying like her Harry Potter character namesake.&nbsp;</li>
   <li> My favorite TV show is <i>Parks & Rec</i>, and I quote it regularly.</li>   
   <li>In my last role, I led study abroad programs in Australia, Costa Rica, Rwanda, and South Africa. Such work involved retrieving geckos from screaming students' hotel rooms, sharing my enthusiasm for travel and cross-cultural experiences, and learning A LOT about myself, leadership, and the importance of flexibility.  </li> 
   <li>As a book drunkard and trivia night enthusiast, I love learning as much as I can about pretty much everything - from technology to history to science to mostly utterly random and useless stuff.</li>
